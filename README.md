# High-level-overview-of-DS-problem
Here is a high-level overview of the typical steps involved in solving a data science problem:

1) Problem definition: Start by clearly defining the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you understand the type of data you need, the target variable you want to predict, and the appropriate evaluation metrics to use.

2) Data acquisition and exploration: Once you have defined the problem, the next step is to acquire the relevant data. This can involve gathering data from various sources, such as APIs, databases, or web scraping. Once you have the data, explore it to get a sense of its quality, distribution, and features. Use visualization and statistical techniques to identify any missing values, outliers, or patterns in the data.

3) Data preparation and feature engineering: After exploring the data, the next step is to prepare it for modeling. This can involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format that can be fed into a model. Feature engineering is also important, as it involves creating new variables or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the model.

4) Model selection and training: Once the data is prepared, the next step is to select an appropriate model and train it on the data. This can involve trying different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model for the problem. During this stage, it is important to use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

5) Evaluation and tuning: After training the model, evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. This will give you an idea of how well the model is generalizing to new data. Use evaluation metrics appropriate for the problem and compare the performance of different models. If necessary, tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.

6) Deployment and monitoring: Once you have a model that meets the desired performance, deploy it to a production environment. This can involve setting up an API or a web application to make predictions on new data. Finally, monitor the performance of the model over time to ensure that it continues to perform well and update the model as needed.

7) In terms of tools and techniques, there are many options available depending on the problem you are trying to solve. Some common tools include Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used to explore and visualize the data. Techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and regularization can be used to tune the model hyperparameters. Finally, cloud-based services such as AWS, Azure, or GCP can be used for deployment and monitoring.
